            Helpmet is a smart construction helmet that allows construction site workers to community effectively with each other on-site, and know when the public has crossed into their construction site.

    </div>

	<div class="project_text">
        We started with desk research to gather key insights about the industry. Through in-person interviews and observations, we were able to understand the main motivations and pain points of workers. We consolidated our data to develop hypothesis about a product that would be able to help construction workers overcome their most prominent challenges at work. We talked over our initial product ideas with workers to gather feedback, and create iterations of the product.

            We spoke with Emily Sparer, a research fellow at the Harvard Centre for Work, Health, and Wellbeing. We also spoked with John Nardone, the Cambridge deputy Commissioner for Public Works. Through our fieldwork, we were trying to gather insight on:

                                Our design research suggested that lack of public understanding or awareness are challenges workers have to overcome at construction sites. Our hypothesis is when construction spaces are better defined and construction workers have assistance monitoring the public, construction workers wonâ€™t have to worry as much about the public.
We brainstormed potential issues to target:

<ul>
    <li>
        Lack of social community amongst workers

    </li>
    <li>
         Workers feeling under-appreciated

    </li>
    <li>
        Workers feeling under-appreciated

    </li>
    <li>
            Negative perceptions of each other (both the workers and the public)
    </li>
</ul>

and a solution criteria:

<ul>
    <li>
            easy to incorporate into existing construction site
    </li>
    <li>
            adaptable across types of construction sites 
    </li>
    <li>
            applicable to workers from different backgrounds
    </li>
</ul>

How we would test our hypotheses to know if our assumptions so far are valid enough to warrant additional time and investment:
We will test three different sites in the following four groups (12 sites total) in similar location settings and types of construction occurring:

<ul>
    <li>
            Better defined space group: sites would have clearly defined boundaries, with physical barriers and other methods of differentiating the work site from general public areas

    </li>
    <li>
            Assistance monitoring the public: sites would provide assistance to managers to be notified when passerbys cross onto the site
 
    </li>
    <li>
            Better defined space + assistance monitoring the public: sites would incorporate both defined physical boundaries as well as public monitoring assistance

    </li>
</ul>
